# LibrarySignUp
Automatically sign up for BLS library.

## Use:
1. Install Java if you don't have it
2. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/PantherMan594/LibrarySignUp/releases)
3. Run the LibrarySignUp.jar file
4. Input your studies, email, and password (note: use your pickatime email and password. This information will never leave your computer, and is _only_ used to automatically sign in. If you want to look into the source, you can see that I'll _never_ have access to either your email or your password)
5. Press submit, make sure there aren't any errors, and minimize the window (note: your computer needs to be on during the sign up time for this to work)
6. When the time comes, it will automatically fill in _everything_. Just let it do its job, but if it messes up you can do it manually.
